Hi, I am Yuechi Zhou (周月驰), a second-year graduate student supervised by Assoc. Prof. [Juntao Li](https://lijuntaopku.github.io) at Soochow University. In 2025.09, I will pursue a Ph.D. under Prof. [Li Zhenghua](https://web.suda.edu.cn/zhli13/) at Soochow University (Master-PhD combined program).

Before this, I received my Bachelor’s degree (2019-2023, computer science) from Soochow University.

My research interest includes Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLM). I am committed to constructing high-performance and efficient deployment algorithms for LLMs, exploring more economical and convenient applications of LLMs in various fields.
> Exploration is limitless, innovation knows no boundaries.
